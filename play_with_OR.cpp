/*You are given an array arr[], you have to re-construct an array arr[].
The values in arr[] are obtained by doing OR(bitwise or) of consecutive elements in the array.

Example :

â€¹Input : arr[ ] = {10, 11, 1, 2, 3}
Output : 11 11 3 3 3
Explanation:
At index 0, arr[0] or arr[1] = 11
At index 1, arr[1] or arr[2] = 11
At index 2, arr[2] or arr[3] = 3
...
At index 4, No element is left So, it will 
remain as it is.
New Array will be {11, 11, 3, 3, 3}.*/
